#### An NAME app

## Technologies Used

* HTML 
* CSS 
* Javascript

## Description
Test driven development. 

### Objectives 

To create an app with npm and unit tests with Jest.

### Goals
* Use of npm to manage packages, webpack to bundle code, and ESLint to lint code. If you are installing and configuring these dependencies from scratch, make sure to create your .gitignore first!
* Complete unit tests for all business logic using TDD and Jest. Aim for 100% test coverage.
* Complete separation of logic (UI logic in one file, business logic in another). You may even need to refactor some of your logic to make it more testable! If you aren't able to test UI logic, consider ways that logic could be refactored and moved into your business logic file.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo to your workspace.
* Navigate to the top level of the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs.
